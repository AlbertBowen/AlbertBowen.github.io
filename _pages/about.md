I am Linping YUAN (袁林萍), currently a research assistant professor at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE), The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). I received my Ph.D. at HKUST VisLab at CSE of HKUST, supervised by Prof. Huamin Qu. Before that, I obtained my bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering from Xi’an Jiaotong University (XJTU) in 2019.

My research interests lie in the intersection of virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR), human-computer interaction (HCI), and data visualization (VIS). I design and develop algorithms, interactive tools, and visual analytic systems to facilitate the creation of various artifacts, including 2D visualizations and infographics, AR data videos, and VR animated stories. Specifically, my research 1) provides computational creativity support by mining design practices from large datasets with deep learning techniques, and 2) adopts data-driven approach to facilitate creators understand and improve the way audience interact with their artifacts.

Welcome to drop me an email if you are interested in my research or want to explore research collaboration :D


I am Bowen LIU (刘博文), currently a Postdoc Researcher in [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) iSING Lab](https://ising.cse.ust.hk/), worked with [Prof. Kai Chen](http://www.cse.ust.hk/~kaichen/). I received my Ph.D. in computer science and technology from Nanjing University (NJU), supervised by [Prof. Wanchun Dou](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/douwanchun/index.htm) in [LANDS lab](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/lands/) (Outstanding Graduate) in 2024.

#### Research Interests

- Host Network Architecture
- Datacenter Networking
- Distributed System
- Edge Computing


My research interests lie in building high-performance and intelligent networking systems. I am currently working with [Dr. Xinyang HUANG](https://huangxy-minel.github.io/) on [Axio](https://github.com/axio-project) an open-source framework for accelerated network I/O systems. Axio aims to deliver high-performance, programmable, and extensible network services for datacenter applications. We are always open to discussions and collaborations on research and open-source projects.
